# Convolution Recurrent Neural Nets
First of all, i would like to thank [Jieru Mei](https://github.com/meijieru). My repo was heavily based on his repo.

This repo implemented convolution recurrent neural nets(CRNN) for handwritten recognition, optical character recognition. CRNN can use for many text levels: character, word, or even a text line. 

In this repo, I try to provide a simple API which help everyone can train their own model. This model, which i have used for many industry projects, can guarantee to work well in many cases.
